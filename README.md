# Income and Expense Monitoring Application

## Application Overview

  This is an application, which will help you monitor and track your income and expenses. You can view, add and delete income(s) and expense(s) as well as edit existing income(s) and expense(s). With expenses you can add them or edit them according to category as well. The application can be used in light or dark mode (by clicking the lightbulb on the home screen) and the separate income and expense screens use coloured rings so you can see the by proportion your largest and/or smallest expense/income. 

## Screens of the application

  ### Home Screen 

   -  At the top is the name of the screen with a lightbulb you can click to change the theme to and from light/dark theme.
   -  Next is your total balance which is calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total incomes.
   -  Below the total balance are cards which display the "TOTAL INCOME" and "TOTAL EXPENSE" with up and down arrow icons to better distinguish them.
   -  Next by scrolling down you can see the rows with the first three incomes and expenses and a button called "SEE ALL" below. By clicking "SEE ALL" you will be taken to the income screen or expense screen.
   -  If you scroll all the way down to the bottom you will see "Insert Income" and "Insert Expense" buttons; if you click them you will see a random income/expense be added to the rows of existing ones, but only
      three will remain shown. Doing this will change the total balance as well as the "TOTAL INCOME" and "TOTAL EXPENSE" card amounts.
   -  Importantly, there is a bottom full width tab bar, which has a row of icons (dollar icons with down and up arrows, home icon and a floating action button (with a "+" sign in the centre of it)).
